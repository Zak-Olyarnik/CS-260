I started by creating a Heap class, which, in addition to having a .makeHeap
method and the .downHeap needed to help it, also includes the other priority
queue operations like .insert and .upHeap.  The directions said to
"implement a priority queue", so I thought it should have all of the normal
functionality, even if the rest of it is not used in the core of the
assignment.  There's also a lot of subtlety in the class, such as stuffing a
0 into array[0] so that the left and right children simplify to 2i and 2i+1,
respectively, and the parent is i/2.

I had a lot of problems with the timeit function this time around.  First,
it didn't like that .makeHeap was a method, not a function, so I wrote a
dummy make_heap which simply called it.  But I still couldn't have arguments
with timeit, so I attempted another wrapper script like we used for hw2.
But for some reason it couldn't pick up my heap or array in the same way
that it got the lists in hw2.  I tried a few other things and looked up the
timeit documentation, but I still couldn't get anything to work and resorted
to making my heap and array into global variables.  I know that this is
generally frowned upon, but it got timeit to work without all the extra
bouncing around.

I ran make_heap with arrays full of random numbers, sized 10000 to 100000
elements.  I wasn't sure if this was a good or even a realistic range but
the largest was still timed at under 200 ms so it at least it won't hold up
any computers.
